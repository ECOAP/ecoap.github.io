## ECOAP Project 

The project "ECOAP: Experimental assessment of congestion control strategies for the Constrained Application Protocol" is funded by the WiSHFUL project under the fifth open call for experiments (call WiSHFUL-OC5-EXP-EXC). The project aims at evaluating, by means of real experiments the performance of different congestion control strategies for the CoAP protocol exploiting the WiSHFUL platform.

The project is currently on-going. Here you will find results and tools for further evaluation of congestion control strategies.
